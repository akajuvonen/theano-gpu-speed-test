# theano-gpu-speed-test
Testing how much gpu speeds up calculations in a simple example.

## Instructions

### Install dependencies

NOTE: Tested on Ubuntu 17.04.

First, you need Python and Conda. I recommend [MiniConda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html). In addition, [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) and [CuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) must be installed. You need a free NVidia developer account for CuDNN. Then just run `bin/init` to make a Conda virtual environment with required dependencies.

### Run the analysis

TODO: Not finished yet. Use `bin/run` to actually run the analysis. The init script must be run before this, otherwise it will just print an error.

### Cleaning

In order to clean the virtual environment, use `bin/clean`.

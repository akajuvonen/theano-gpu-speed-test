## Instructions

### Install dependencies

Before beginning, you need python, pip and virtualenv. Everything else will be installed using pip in virtualenv. It does not mess with your system-wide python libraries.

To automatically create a virtualenv environment and install dependencies if needed, run `bin/init` script. It will install dependencies in the virtual environment if not already done.
